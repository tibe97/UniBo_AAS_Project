# Mini-Project: Autonomous and Adaptive Systems

 Taking inspiration from existing methods, which leverage self-supervised learning methods to improve the efficiency of Reinforcement Learning algorithms during the training phase, an approach combining BYOL method with a Double DQN agent is proposed.
